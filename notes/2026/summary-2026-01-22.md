The January GraphQL working group meeting focused on three main technical proposals: Pascal presented a specification for semantic introspection to enable LLMs to interact more effectively with GraphQL APIs, Mark shared a proposal for AI-powered mocking capabilities to help developers test GraphQL queries locally, and Michael Watson demonstrated a working implementation of GraphQL embeddings using open-source models that can generate dynamic operations from schema data. The group discussed various technical approaches including embedding strategies, pagination capabilities, and integration with existing tools, with particular interest in making these solutions accessible to developers using free and open-source technologies. The conversation ended with discussions about potential future integration of these capabilities into the GraphQLJS implementation and the positive collaboration between different community members working on complementary aspects of the proposals.

## Next Steps

- Pascal: Conduct experiments with semantic introspection for LLM-GraphQL interaction and prepare to discuss findings and/or demo at the May GraphQL conference.
- Kewei: Schedule a follow-up meeting between Mark, Jordan (Relay client representative), and interested parties to discuss integration and sharing of mock data between different use cases (e.g., unit test mocks and dev-time mocks).
- Michael Watson: Open source the GraphQL Embeddings library, including support for pgvector, Postgres, and pglite, and release the associated VS Code extension.
- Michael Watson: Add support for more embedding providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to the GraphQL Embeddings library.
- Michael Watson: Add functionality to the library/extension for updating embeddings incrementally when the schema changes (e.g., using a changelog and hash-based updates).
- Michael Watson: Submit a talk proposal for GraphQLConf covering the dynamic operation generation and embedding work.
- Pascal and Kewei: Flesh out more details of the semantic introspection spec (including possible pagination and hybrid approaches) and prepare to bring it to the main working group for feedback.
- Thore: Share information or links with Michael Watson about native compilation of embedding models and potential fine-tuning for smaller, specialized models.

## Summary

### GraphQL Working Group January Meeting

The January meeting of the GraphQL working group began with introductions from members including Kewei, Pascal, Michael Watson, Erik, Thor, Michael Crystal, Dale, and Raymie. Kewei announced the upcoming GraphQL Conference 2026, scheduled for May 6-7 at Meta's Menlo Park office, and encouraged attendees to submit AI-related talk proposals by February 1st. The conversation ended with Pascal being given the floor to discuss the day's main agenda topics.

### Semantic GraphQL API Search Proposal

Pascal presented a proposal for semantic introspection, a way for LLMs to communicate with GraphQL APIs. The idea is to extend GraphQL introspection with semantic search capabilities, allowing LLMs to find and construct queries more efficiently. The proposal includes returning schema coordinates, paths to the root, and scores to help LLMs navigate the schema. The group discussed potential improvements like pagination and batch resolution. They agreed to experiment more and potentially bring the proposal to the main working group for further discussion.

### GraphQL Mocking and Embeddings Demo

Mark presented a proposal for a GraphQL mock directive that would allow developers to write queries and use AI to generate mock responses, particularly useful for testing new schemas before backend implementation. Kewei discussed the challenges of UI-first vs data-first development approaches and suggested exploring hybrid mocking approaches for partial queries. Michael Watson demonstrated a working example of GraphQL embeddings using open-source models, showing how LLMs can generate dynamic operations from schema data, and announced plans to open-source a library called GraphQL Embeddings with support for pgvector and different AI models.
